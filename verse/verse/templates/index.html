            <h2>How well do companies know you?</h2>
            <p>For some, privacy is a top concern, but for others, it’s merely a peripheral concept bolstered 
                by the “Nothing to Hide” argument. In fact, the vast majority blindly trust companies and click 
                “I accept” out of carelessness or ignorance. However, in an age when people are more often online 
                than not, we just want our user to be educated before they make a decision about their increasingly 
                growing data. Verse is our attempt to help people get “versed” on how much and what kind of 
                data companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple take from them.
            </p>
            <h2>So what happens when you submit your data?</h2>
            <p>
                Once you submit your data, we will be looking through your data with our parser and put together 
                a big summary of what data companies have on you!
            </p>
            <h2>So does that mean our information will be shared?</h2>
            <p>
                Absolutely not! We want to show how much data other companies have accumulated, not contribute to it! 
                So, once we finish making the summary for your files, we will delete the contents as well as the data 
                gained from said files and the parsed data once you leave the results screen!
            </p>

                What happens when Verse parses our data?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Your raw data is uploaded onto the server, where our parser will look through each file line by line. 
                The data that we gain from it will go straight to your results page, and once our parser is done, 
                all of the data that you submitted will be deleted. <b>Your data will not be shared with any outside parties.</b>
            </p>
